Programming Task Specification: :christmas_tree: Santa's Elf Gift-Wrapping Game :gift:
Overview
Create a simple, interactive Christmas-themed game where the player takes on the role of one of Santa's elves. The elf is responsible for deciding whether children on Santa’s list receive their requested gift or a lump of coal based on their behavior throughout the year. The game will use emojis as the primary graphical elements.
Game Features
Input:
A list of children, each represented by:
Name (string)
"Goodness Score" (integer between 0 and 100)
Gift Wish (string or emoji)
A threshold score (e.g., 50) to determine if a child gets a gift or coal.
Gameplay Loop:
Display a child’s stats (Name, Goodness Score, and Gift Wish) using text and emojis.
Allow the player to choose:
:gift: Wrap the Gift (if the child is good enough).
:rock: Give Coal (if the child is too naughty).
The player’s choice determines the outcome.
Output:
Show the wrapped gift or lump of coal using emojis.
Keep track of correct decisions (did the elf follow the goodness threshold?).
End Game:
After all children on the list have been processed, display:
A summary of gifts vs. coal.
Player’s accuracy in following the goodness threshold.
Logic Design
Child Evaluation:
If Goodness Score ≥ Threshold:
Action: Wrap the requested gift :gift:.
Display: “:gift: Wrapping [Gift Emoji]! [Child Name] has been good this year.”
Else:
Action: Give a lump of coal :rock:.
Display: “:rock: [Child Name] gets coal! Naughty behavior.”
Player Input Validation:
Ensure the player’s decision aligns with the goodness score.
Track and evaluate the player’s decisions:
Correct Decision: Player action matches score-based logic.
Incorrect Decision: Player action contradicts score-based logic.
Game Flow:
Loop through all children in the list.
At each iteration, display the child’s stats and wait for the player’s input.
Process the input and update outcomes.
End Summary:
Total Gifts Wrapped :gift:.
Total Coal Given :rock:.
Accuracy Score: Percentage of correct decisions.
